### NOT-SO-PREDICTING Stock prediction Model

## To run:

# Install the necessary packages
pandas, pytorch, scipy, gym-trading-env, gymnasium, matplotlib, numpy, pickle
Other packages may be needed but usually are already installed in most environments.

# Run the model
To test it, just run test_model.py; it will start the "training" of the model.
You can see that it starts learning very quickly, and after 4 or 5 episodes it's already making a lot of profit.

# Visualize statistics
Every once in a while during training the model will output some stats to wip_render_logs.
You can run the script inside this folder and follow the link shown in the terminal to visualize the results of the training session.
